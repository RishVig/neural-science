Of course! Let's break down the code in simple terms:

1. The code is using a computer program called Python to build a simple artificial brain (neural network) that can do some basic tasks.

2. The brain (neural network) needs some math functions, so it imports a special math library called "numpy" and gives it a short name "np."

3. The program also uses another library called "nnfs" to create a simple dataset (set of data) for the brain to learn from.

4. The brain has different parts (functions) that work together to learn and make decisions. The program defines three functions for the brain:

   a. "activation_relu" function: It's like a switch that activates only if the input is positive (greater than zero). Otherwise, it stays off (zero).
   
   b. "layer_dense" function: It's like a layer of connected dots. Each dot has a weight (importance) and a bias (how much to add or subtract). The brain will learn these weights and biases to solve the task.
   
   c. "activation_softmax" function: It's like another switch, but this one helps the brain make decisions. It converts raw numbers into probabilities, helping the brain choose the most likely answer.

5. The program creates a simple dataset, like a list of points with labels, to train the brain. The brain will learn from these points and labels.

6. It's time to put the brain to work! The program sets up the brain:

   a. The brain starts with a layer called "dense1" that connects two dots and has three dots in the output layer.
   
   b. The brain also has an activation function called "activation1" that turns on some of the output dots based on whether they are positive or not.
   
   c. Then, the brain has another layer called "dense2" with three dots in the input and three dots in the output.
   
   d. The brain uses the "activation_softmax" function to make decisions based on the output of "dense2."

7. Finally, the program tells the brain to think by processing the dataset. It tells the brain to do the following steps in order:

   a. Take the input data from the dataset and pass it through the first layer "dense1."
   
   b. Activate the output of "dense1" using the "activation_relu" function.
   
   c. Take the result from the previous step and pass it through the second layer "dense2."
   
   d. Activate the output of "dense2" using the "activation_softmax" function.

8. After thinking, the brain produces an output, and the program prints the first five results to see what the brain has learned.

In summary, this code is like a basic artificial brain with two layers that can learn from a simple dataset and make decisions based on that learning. It uses math functions to process the data and make decisions.
